            <p>
                Hello, my name is Devin Picklesimer! I'm a software engineer, learner,
                husband, and soon-to-be father. My wife Kaitlin and I currently live in Rexburg, Idaho
                but are looking to live in Ohio or Michigan where we're originally from! I love sports, 
                movies, games, music, <strong>FOOD</strong>, and spending time with family and friends.

            <h2>
            My Story...
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm from Dayton, Ohio and have lived there for most of my life. I came to Idaho in 2018 to attend
                college at Brigham Young University - Idaho. At BYU-I I began studying human anatomy and physiology with the intent
                on becoming a registered nurse, but I took some programming classes as well. The programming classes captured
                my interest and imagination much more so I eventually made the switch to software engineering. I graduated in April of 2023
                with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering.

                <br><br>My wonderful wife, Kaitlin, and I got married in 2022. We currently live in Rexburg and are expecting our first baby
                in February next year! We are very excited to start our family.

            <h2>
                My Dreams For the Future...
            </h2>
            <p>
                The biggest goal I have is to have a job that I enjoy. I'm no stranger to hard work, but doing work that also
                brings you satisfaction is one of my greatest dreams. I have always enjoyed providing for myself, and I can have 
                a very entrepreneurial spirit so I would like to have a business of my own someday.
                
                <br><br>I'm very knew to the software development industry, so I don't quite
                know what kind of job I want to stay in yet. My current programming interests are web and mobile development. I
                really enjoy creating something like a web page or application that <strong>anyone</strong> can see and use. I like
                showing off these projects that are easy to share.

                <br><br>Overall, I'm looking for a role that I can grow into and stay in for a long time.
